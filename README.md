# What is this Project about?

This is a Project for one of my university classes. Goal of the project was to create a trading card game that can be communicated with via http requests.
However we were supposed to implement http features outselves over using a library that already implements these.

# What Features does the Game Support?

You can buy cards, trade cards, build decks, engage in battles and view the leaderboard.
There is a large variety of cards that interact differently with eachother based on their typing and allegiance.
